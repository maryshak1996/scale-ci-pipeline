# SCALE-CI-PIPELINE
Automates the installation of OCP on various cloud platforms and runs performance and scale tests related to kubelet density, control plane, http, storage, prometheus and cluster limits.

NOTE: This is also maintained at openshift/aos-cd-jobs repo [https://github.com/openshift/aos-cd-jobs].

### Dependencies
```
- Running Jenkins instance.
```

## Components
- Properties files
- Pipeline scripts
- scale-ci-watcher
- scale-ci-linter

### Properties files
The parameters/configuration of each Job in the scale-ci-pipeline is supplied through the properties files. It contains key=value pairs, the sample properties for all the supported jobs are hosted in scale-ci/properties.

### Pipeline scripts
These scripts are responsible for parsing the properties files and building the respective Job.

### Scale-ci-watcher
This looks for changes to the JJB templates or new templates and updates/onboards the Jobs into the scale-ci-pipeline. The watcher also supports xml format, it has the support to convert them to JJB format.

### Scale-ci-linter
Validates scale-ci templates to analyze them for potential errors for every commit. This can be run locally as well in case we want to check before pushing the commit:
```
$ pip install yamllint
$ ./scale-ci-linter.sh <path-to-the-template>
```

### Supported Jobs by Scale-CI
